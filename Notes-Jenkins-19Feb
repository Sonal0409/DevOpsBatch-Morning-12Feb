MAVEN : 
=========================
> It is a powerful tool which helps in building, managing and documenting your project

> Maven by heart is a plugin based tool

> whenever a maven command is executed, its output will be stored in folder called target

> It has 2 types of plugins:

Core Build plugins:
===================================================================================================
Task  					Plugin					GOAL/Commands 	    		 output
===================================================================================================
Compile the code  			Compiler					mvn compile				.class files

execute some Testcases		 Surefire				        mvn test				test passed/failed status

Package the code			package					mvn package           	 .war file

Clean the previous build	        clean					 mvn clean			clean up from target folder
files

install all dependencies	        install					mvn install


In maven multiple goals can be executed together

# mvn clean install package



Reporting plugins:
==============================
Will always generate reports, and in maven the reports are mostly generated in the format : xml,html,txt

Task  						Plugin				GOAL/Commands 	                        output

Code Review				pmd						mvn pmd:pmd		               pmd.xml report	

test reports				surefire					mvn test		              surefire reports - xml,txt

Code coverage			cobertura,JACOCO,sonarqube	mvn sonar:sonar		coverage.xml



Structure MAVEN project

src/main/java   ==> source code will be present
src/test/java   ==> test cases will be present

pom.xml   ==> heart of maven project

 1. dependencies   ==> tools downloded by developer to write code
 2. plugin information
 3. Repositories ( local, central & remote)
URls or location from ehre we have to download the plugin or dependency

===============================================

Demo 3: Jenkins + maven integration:

Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins-->Global Tool configuration

Under GIT==> leave it same 

Under maven ==> lets install it automatically
Type mymaven and check the install automatically box.
Save the changes


**********************************
Job Package Job
***************************

Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Package==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes
 
build ==> invoke top level maven target==>mymaven

 goal = clean install package

==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

==> go to workspace ==> target/addressbook.war

==========================================================================

pipelines Using plugins are called as Plugin based pipelines or Upstream and downstream pipelines
These pipelines are created using freestyle jobs.

Jenkins allows us to create multiple task in one single job.

Whenever a user has to perfom set of tasks one after other (in a sequence) or in parallel, it can easily be done using 
pipleine project template in jenkins

Pipleines in jenkins are nothing but set of task executed in sequence(by default) 

When a user is creating a pipeline we will have to write code for it.
The pipeline code is based on Groovy scripting which is Domain specific lanaguage
In jenkins pipeline code using 2 types of syntax

 > scripted pipeline syntax  --> jenkins version 1
=======================================
> scripted pipeline syntax always starts with a keyword called as node
> When Jenkins version1 came in to the market, the admin used scripted pipeline syntax to write pipeline code
> scripted pipeline syntax is difficult to read and write.
> there is no structure or no definite style which writitng the code
> The code written scripted pipeline syntax is not validated by jenkins
> This syntax is no longer used
> if the pipeline fails, you have to run the pipeline from the begining

 > Declarative pipeline syntax  -> Version 2
========================================
> Declarative pipeline syntax always starts with a keyword called as pipeline
> With jenkins version2, Declarative pipeline syntax was introduced
> This is well structured syntax, where user is provided with definite pipeline sections
> we need to just declare the pipeline code
> It declarative in nature, syntax is very simple
> if the pipeline failes, you can restart the pipeline form the point that it had failed previously
> Stages in pipeline means Job to be executed
> Every stage will have a Name in the pipeline, steps to be executed, post build steps, 
> jenkins provides a pipeline code snippet generator, that helps your to learn pipeline scripting very fast

Syntax:  key 'value' 
for example: name 'Jenkins'
             sh 'echo "hello All"'

Structure of Declarative pipeline syntax

=========================================

pipeline{

 tools{
  // names of tools configured that jenkins  will use while executing the pipleline
}

agents {
 // name of the server where jenkisn can dispatch the jobs
}

parameters{
               name 'Sonal'
}

triggers{

pollSCM('* * * * *')

}

// to write comments
// stages is the mandory section in a pipeline
stages{

stage('job1'){

steps{
        sh 'echo $name'   
}

}

parallel {

stage('job2'){

steps{   //build steps
           // what shoudl this job do
}

}

stage('job3'){

steps{
           // what shoudl this job do
}

}

}



}
 

}

==============================

pipeline{
    
    tools{
        maven 'mymaven'
    }
   // in agent any = any available server 
    agent any
   stages{
       stage('Clone a Repo'){
           steps{
               git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
           }
       }
       
       stage('Compile the code'){
           steps{
               sh 'mvn compile'
           }
       }
       
       stage('CodeReview'){
           steps{
               sh 'mvn pmd:pmd'
           }
       }
       
       stage('Unit Test'){
           steps{
               sh 'mvn test'
           }
       }
       
       stage('Package'){
           steps{
               sh 'mvn clean install package'
           }
       }
       }
}




Parallel stages

pipeline{
    
    tools{
        maven 'mymaven'
    }

    agent any

   stages{
       stage('Clone a Repo'){
           steps{
               git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
           }
       }

      stage('parallel stage') {

      parallel {

       	stage('Compile the code'){
          	 steps{
              	 sh 'mvn compile'
          	 }
      	 }
       
       stage('CodeReview'){
           	steps{
               sh 'mvn pmd:pmd'
           }
       }
    }

Master and Slave Set up

restart the instance.
Restart the jenkins server
now take public ip and loginto jenkins

Step 1: Go to Manage Jenkins ---> CONFIGURE SYSTEM ---> Check the Jenkins URL is same as URL of browser --> Save
Step 2: Go to Manage Jenkins---> CONFIGURE GLOBAL SECURITY --> Scroll down to AGENTS-->select RANDOM radiobutton--> Save
Step 3: Go to Manage Jenkins---> MAnage Nodes and Clouds  --> New Node

Select New Node--> give name as Winslave--> select radio button permanamet Agent

Name : winslave
Description: give windows 10 machine 
==> # of executors = 1 ==> means number of jobs that we want to run on this slave node. Let it be 1 for now
===> Remote root directory ==> C:\jenkinsdir
Location of a directory folder on your windows machine , so that jenkins can create a workspace folder and store all the files. As we have seen earlier while executiong jobs.
For this --> got to C drive and create an emapty folder.
C:\jenkinsdir

====>  Label : win_slave ==> this is like a tag to slave machine. This is how we will identify the slave machine--> remeber this

===> Usage: 
Select 2nd option: Only build jobs with label expressionmatching the job :
This means for which ever job we will give label as win_slave that job only will run on this job.

===> Launch Method : select option : Launch agent by connecting to master.

Scroll down

Add tools

Add git path as C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe
Add java path as C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_191

SAVE the job.

Now go to win_slave ==> download the agent.jar file and put it in your jenkinsdir folder.

Copy the path and change the public ip in below path
java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://3.139.60.71:8080/computer/winslave/slave-agent.jnlp -secret 61e8e20badd531b48caeffac8d686f182eb2d77a1c303ee39c5db9d00117c0be -workDir "C:\jenkinsdir"

Go to bash and start jenkins, refresh instance
Go to cmd prompt
change to cd c:\jenkinsdir
copy the above jenkins agent path
System will get connected.

================================================
Master and Agent Set up
=============================================================

Step 1: create a workder/agent node (VM of type Amazon linux2) on AWS

Step 2: Install git and java on worker node

# yum install git -y
# sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

Step 3: Create remote root directory on the worker & give permissions for access

cd /tmp

mkdir jenkinsdir

Path: /tmp/jenkinsdir

Give permission to remote root directory

chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir

Step 4: Go to master machine and update Jenkins URL

Manage Jenkins> Configure System > update the latest jenkins URL to the current url > save the page


Step 5: On master machine open Agent port

Manage Jenkins> Configure Global Security> scroll down to agents > select random and save the page

Step 6: Configure worker/agent node on master

Manage Jenkins> Manage nodes and clouds

Number of executors= executor = Job ==> 1
remote root directory : /tmp/jenkinsdir
label : linux_node
Usage: only build jobs with matching labels


Launch method: launch agents via SSH

Host: private IP of agent node

Credentials: click on Add button > click on jenkins

Select Kind : SSH username and private key

username: ec2-user

Private key: you will get the private key of the agent node in your local laptop> downloads folder

got the downloads folder of laptop, search for the key(.pemfile)

open the file with notepad and copy the entire text

paste the text in jenkins > under private key


Now select the credials from the drop down.


step 7: Host Key Verification Strategy


Step 7: check if connection is succesfull

Step 8: add agent in the piepline

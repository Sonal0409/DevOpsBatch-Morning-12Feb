1. It is better that you write and maintain your pipeline code in Github, so that many team members can collaborate to the pipeline
2. it allows version control the changes done on pipelines.

3. How will jenkins read pipeline code from github?

Jenkins uses the concept of Jenkinsfile

It is a simple text file. it has no extention 
Name is preffered as Jenkinsfile
This is the file in which we will maintain pipeline code ->in the Version control tool


Jenkins--> pipelinetemplate--> from github fetch jenkinsfile--> execute pipeline code for you.
==================================


CI/Cd pipeline

Code in github repo

https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git

Build the code ==> maven ==> addressbook.war

/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/CICDpipeline/target/addressbook.war

build a docker file

FROM tomcat:9
COPY addressbook.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
EXPOSE 8080
CMD  ["catalina.sh", "run"]

Chnage the name of image
push to dockerhub
===========================

Create the following pipeline in jenkins

pipeline{
    tools{
        maven 'mymaven'
    }
    agent any
    stages{
        stage('clone repo'){
            steps{
                git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Code'){
            steps{
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
        
        stage('build Image'){
          
            steps{
                sh 'cp /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/CICDpipeline/target/addressbook.war .'
                sh 'docker build -t myaddressbook .'
            }
        }
        

        
        stage('Deploy container'){
            steps{
                sh 'docker run -d -P edu123/myaddressbook'
            }
        }
    }
}


Before executing the pipleine give jenkins permsision to run docker commands
 chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock

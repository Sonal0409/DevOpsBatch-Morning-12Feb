6. Modify an exisitng tracked files and add those changes to local repo
====================================================

Take a file which is in local repo

# git ls-files

# vim index1.html

Press i to add any data

press ESC key and press :wq and pres senter key 
& save the file

# git status

status of file is modified

To add all the modification and commit them to local repo

# git commit -a -m "added modifications"


7. If some files are not required to be tracked by GIT --> ignore certain files for version control

=================================================

Git provides the concept of .gitignore, where in we create a file with the name .gitignore
And we will add names of the files that we dont want to track
This concept is applicable to files which are new and untracked

# vim .gitignore

In this file insert the name of files to be ingores

press i

*.xml
*.php
*.log

:wq

# git status

This concept this applicable to new file(files that are not commited)
It is only for untracked file.

# sudo su -

# cd myproject

1. Check the log for commit history

# git log

in this HEAD it is an object in git which represents the latest/recent commit id

# git log --oneline

Check commit history of every commit in a single line

# git show <commid id>
Shows what happened in that commit.

See commits of a particular file:

 git log --graph --all -- index1.html


2. Create a feature branch in git  and switch to the branch

========================================

# git branch

Create a new branch

# git branch feature1

Switch to the new branch

# git checkout feature1

[OR]

Create a new branch and switch to the branch also

# git checkout -b feature2

3. Merge the commits/files of new branch to master

Before merging always switch to the destination branch

# git checkout master

# git merge feature1 master

< git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch>


Check which branches are merged to master

git branch -a --merged master

Check which branches are not merged to master

git branch -a --no-merged master


4. Delete a branch which is not merged with master branch

# git branch -D <branchname>

Delete a branch whose commits have been merged with the master branch

# git branch -d feature1


5. Reset the commit history

# git reset --hard <commitid>

here:

commit id is where the HEAD will point to now.

All the other commits above it will be deleted and the chnages will also be deleted from LR and working directory.

It is a destructive command


6. Rebase merging strategy in GIT (rewind the commit history)

# git branch

you should be on the master branch

Now create a new branch

# git branch feature1

On the master branch create 2  new commits

example of my log on master branch

8bce083 (HEAD -> master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e (feature1) added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


Now switch to feature branch and create 2 new commits


example of my log on master branch

9981946 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
156dc12 done in feature branch
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


I want to rebase - re organise the base of my feature branch

Make sure you are on feature branch

# git rebase master


The commit history will be as such:

41f5d79 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
9469e15 done in feature branch
8bce083 (master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html

Dockerfile Keywords:
==========================


1. FROM : 

It is a mandatory keyword. Every dockerfile starts with FROM keyword
FROM keywords defines what will your base image over which you will do your customizations
FROM keywords defines what will the base of your containers

2. LABEL : Maintainer="sonal" => author of the dockerfile

3. ENV:
keyword can be repeated multiple times
If we have to choose some variabels to be used in dockerfile then we use keyword ENV
these variables will be used only in dockerfile
Syntax:
  ENV NGINX_VERSION   1.25.4
Use the variable syntax : $variable_name

4. WORKDIR :
Create a working directory on the container. 
In this workDir, all the below instructions will now be executed in this working directory 

5. RUN:

With RUN keyword we will provide the list of Linux commands that are to be executed on the container
Commands are generally related to install/upgrade/deletion of packages on the container
Creation of directiores on the container
These command would already run and completed whent he container is launched

6. COPY:
Are used to copy files from host server to the containers directory

COPY  hostdirectory/filename    /containerdirectory
COPY /target/sample.war   /usr/share/tomcat/webapps

If you have .tar files, we cannot use COPY keyword


7. ADD:

Are used to copy files from host server to the containers directory
If you have .tar files,we can copy them on containers

ADD keyword will extract the files from .tar file and copy it on the container directory


8. EXPOSE

If we have to assign a port number to container, we use this keyword

Example :  EXPOSE  8090 8087

9. CMD

We will give a command which will get executed once the container lanched. And this command continues to run
Generally these are the final commands that run on the conatiner

In case if only CMD keyword mentioned in dockerfile. Image will build

From that image if we create a container, user can pass a new command to be executed once the containe is launched
The default to be run on the container can be replced by the new command by user at runtime


10. ENTRYPOINT

We will give a command which will get executed once the container lanched. And this command continues to run
Generally these are the final commands that run on the conatiner

In case if only ENTRYPOINT keyword mentioned in dockerfile. Image will build

From that image if we create a container, user can pass a new command to be executed once the container is launched
The default command to be run on the container Willnot be replaced by the new command 
The new command gets appeneded to the entrypoint command.
